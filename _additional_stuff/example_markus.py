YOU ARE waiting for your JC-Agent inside a dark, cold, hopeless room of the Jobcenter HQ in Berlin.

As usual in sweat and fear waiting for the agent to come back with also usual bad news - you notice screams in the hallways.
Is this the day? Are the people finally standing up against the horrible Jobcenter? 
You dont know for sure - as the only thing you hear are screams - followed by deafening silence.

WHAT DO YOU DO?
